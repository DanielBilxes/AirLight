## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 The Problem  
Air pollution in southern Chile (Temuco, Padre Las Casas, Labranza) is a serious health concern.  
Citizens often:  
- Lack fast and reliable information about air quality.  
- Don’t know what preventive measures to take in emergencies.  
- Must search across multiple websites to access local news and updates.  

At the same time, administrators face difficulties in:  
- Communicating alerts to the population in real time.  
- Managing several data sources.  
- Centralizing information into a single registry/digital library.  

### 1.2 Our Solution  
We propose a **mobile application – AirLight** with two profiles:  

- **Citizen User**  
  - Immediately sees the **traffic-light indicator** (green, yellow, red and purple).  
  - Receives clear **health recommendations** according to air status.  
  - Accesses **interactive maps**, **local news**, and an **air quality history**.  

- **Administrator**  
  - Updates the **air status** in real time.  
  - Publishes **recommendations** and **local news**.  
  - Manages **map signals** and **historical data**.  

This solution promotes **awareness, prevention, and efficiency** in communication between authorities and citizens.

## 3. Strategy  

### 3.1 Value Proposition Canvas  
The Value Proposition Canvas aligns the app’s services with the needs of both **citizens** and **administrators**.  

- **Products & Services**:  
  Mobile app, air quality traffic-light, health advice, local news, interactive map, history.  

- **Pain Relievers**:  
  Quick and visual information, practical recommendations, centralized alerts, easy admin tools.  

- **Gain Creators**:  
  Safety and trust for users, awareness in the community, efficient communication, time-saving.

### 3.2 UX Personas  

#### UXP 1 – Physical Education Teacher  
- **Name:** Carlos Muñoz  
- **Age:** 38  
- **Occupation:** Physical Education Teacher  
- **Background:** Works at a high school in Temuco. Organizes outdoor physical activities for students but often struggles to decide if the air is safe. Currently relies on scattered news and personal judgment, which leads to last-minute changes in plans.  
- **Goals:** Ensure students’ health, plan outdoor lessons only if conditions are safe, avoid disruptions in schedules.  
- **Pains:** Lack of reliable info, concern about respiratory problems in students, sudden changes in air quality.  
- **Behaviors (Before AirLight):** Prepares lessons without certainty about air conditions, checks local news or asks colleagues, and frequently cancels or moves activities at the last moment.

#### UXP 2 – Young Adult Athlete  
- **Name:** Daniela Rivas  
- **Age:** 24  
- **Occupation:** University Student, Amateur Runner  
- **Background:** Lives in Padre Las Casas. Enjoys running and cycling outdoors almost every day, but pollution often disrupts her routine. Relies on weather apps or social media that don’t provide clear air quality data.  
- **Goals:** Exercise safely, choose best times and areas for training, avoid interruptions caused by pollution.  
- **Pains:** Frustration when training is canceled due to pollution, lack of forecast, multiple unreliable sources.  
- **Behaviors (Before AirLight):** Wakes up early and decides impulsively if conditions seem “good enough,” sometimes asks friends about alerts, occasionally cuts her run short when noticing bad air quality.  

---

#### UXP 3 – Senior Citizen  
- **Name:** Jorge Ramírez  
- **Age:** 70  
- **Occupation:** Retired Engineer  
- **Background:** Lives in Labranza. Goes for a walk every morning to stay active, but his age and respiratory issues make him vulnerable. Often bases his decision on smell or visibility of the air rather than reliable information.  
- **Goals:** Walk outdoors safely, maintain his routine without risking his health, receive simple and clear guidance.  
- **Pains:** Anxiety about health risks, difficulty interpreting technical information, limited ability to move to cleaner areas.  
- **Behaviors (Before AirLight):** Wakes up early and prepares for his walk without checking formal air data, relies on perception (“the sky looks clear”), and sometimes cancels after feeling unwell outdoors.

### 3.3 Benchmarking

To design an application that truly responds to the needs of citizens and administrators in southern Chile, it was essential to analyze existing air quality platforms — including both direct competitors and indirect references recognized for their design and usability.  

To understand how our air quality application can stand out and truly address user needs, we conducted a comparative analysis of existing solutions in the market.

The goal was to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunity gaps, both functionally and visually, in order to integrate best practices and avoid common pitfalls.

We considered different types of references:
Direct competitors: Air quality applications such as Aire Santiago, AirVisual, and Aire Temuco.
Data platforms: Services recognized for their clear way of displaying environmental and health information.
User experience references: Applications known for their modern, accessible, and minimalistic design, which inspired the aesthetic and usability of our solution.
