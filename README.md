## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 The Problem  
Air pollution in southern Chile (Temuco, Padre Las Casas, Labranza) is a serious health concern.  
Citizens often:  
- Lack fast and reliable information about air quality.  
- Don’t know what preventive measures to take in emergencies.  
- Must search across multiple websites to access local news and updates.  

At the same time, administrators face difficulties in:  
- Communicating alerts to the population in real time.  
- Managing several data sources.  
- Centralizing information in a single platform.  

### 1.2 Our Solution  
We propose a **mobile application – AirLight** with two profiles:  

- **Citizen User**  
  - Immediately sees the **traffic-light indicator** (green, yellow, red).  
  - Receives clear **health recommendations** according to air status.  
  - Accesses **interactive maps**, **local news**, and an **air quality history**.  

- **Administrator**  
  - Updates the **air status** in real time.  
  - Publishes **recommendations** and **local news**.  
  - Manages **map signals** and **historical data**.  

This solution promotes **awareness, prevention, and efficiency** in communication between authorities and citizens.
